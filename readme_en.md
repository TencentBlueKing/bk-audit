## Overview

The BK Audit Center aims to create benchmark audit products based on the BK ecosystem, and through the underlying capabilities of BK, it provides a variety of audit services such as personnel operation audit, business asset audit, and business compliance audit.

## Features

- Unconscious: Once the target data is plugged into the audit, the audit policy silently operates, making the business totally unaware.
- Ubiquitous: As long as there are data traces, the presence of audit can be discerned.
- Solid Proof: Precisely presents all linked evidence of audit risks, leaving no place for all traces to hide.
- AI Intelligent Audit: Supports AI intelligent model auditing. With three simple steps â€“ data integration, policy configuration, and rule setting, it flexibly copes with various complex audit scenarios.
